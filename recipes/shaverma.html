        <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a flavorful chicken dish, which I first tasted at a little Lebanese restaurant. While normally shawarma is sliced off a rotisserie,
         it can be made at home with just a few changes. Be warned, it takes a day of prep time.
          For lunch, serve as a sandwich in warmed flatbread with cucumber sauce, sliced onion, and seeded tomato. For dinner, serve with rice and lentils.</p>
