        <h1>Lebanese Chicken Shawarma</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
         This is a flavorful chicken dish, which I first tasted at a little Lebanese restaurant. While normally shawarma is sliced off a rotisserie,
         it can be made at home with just a few changes. Be warned, it takes a day of prep time.
        For lunch, serve as a sandwich in warmed flatbread with cucumber sauce, sliced onion, and seeded tomato. For dinner, serve with rice and lentils.

        <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
             <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch strips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk yogurt, lemon juice, olive oil, tomato paste, garlic, cumin, coriander, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl.
                 Mix in chicken strips. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to marinate, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
                 <li>Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
                 <li>Remove chicken from the bowl and arrange in a single layer on a broiling pan. Discard excess marinade.</li>
                 <li>Broil chicken, turning once, until juices run clear, about 10 minutes.
                     An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
